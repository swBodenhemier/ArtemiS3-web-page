          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Our solution aims to make NASA's planetary data in AWS S3
            searchable, visual, and secure by enabling fast exploration with
            intuitive search, filters, and dashboards; delivering instant
            results with previews and metadata.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our application will include full-text and metadata search across
            files, a user-friendly dashboard with visualization tools, a tagging
            and organization system built for collaboration, and automated
            checks for risky security configurations.
          </p>
          <p>
            With ArtemiS3, instead of manually browsing through thousands of
            files a user could simply search "Mars Imagery 2020" and instantly
            get results with previews, metadata, and filtering options.
            Researchers could now spend more time actually using the data rather
            than searching for it.

          <ul style="padding-right: 20px">
            <li>
              <h4>Meilisearch — Search Engine</h4>
              <p>
                Meilisearch is a lightweight, open-source search engine designed
                for fast full-text search, typo tolerance, filtering, and
                relevance tuning.
              </p>
              <p>
                It offers a generous free tier, extremely easy integration,
                strong Python support, and simpler setup than Elasticsearch
                while still meeting all functional search requirements.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Svelte — Frontend Framework</h4>
              <p>
                Svelte is a reactive JavaScript framework that compiles
                components into optimized vanilla JavaScript, removing the need
                for a virtual DOM.
              </p>
              <p>
                Svelte provides faster performance on small–medium apps, has an
                easier learning curve than React, and allows smooth UI updates
                for fast-changing search results.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>TailwindCSS — Styling Framework</h4>
              <p>
                TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that uses atomic
                classes to rapidly build consistent, responsive UI components.
              </p>
              <p>
                It enables rapid prototyping, efficient styling, strong
                consistency, and avoids the bulkiness of Bootstrap or the manual
                work of SCSS.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>FastAPI — Backend Framework</h4>
              <p>
                FastAPI is a modern Python framework offering asynchronous
                support, automatic documentation, and Pydantic-based validation.
              </p>
              <p>
                It excels at high-concurrency, I/O-heavy tasks, integrates
                cleanly with AWS and Python tools, and reduces development
                overhead compared to Flask.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Boto3 — AWS S3 SDK</h4>
              <p>
                Boto3 is the official AWS SDK for Python, providing high-level
                tools for interacting with AWS S3 and related services.
              </p>
              <p>
                It offers seamless Python integration, robust pagination and
                retry handling, strong AWS support, and avoids cross-language
                runtime complexity.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>AWS EC2 - Web Server Hosting</h4>
              <p>
                AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a service which provides fast
                and affordable virtual server instances hosted on the cloud
                which can be used for various purposes such as hosting web
                applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                EC2 Instances are highly scalable and integrate well with the
                rest of AWS, support strong and reliable infrastructure, and are
                simple to set up and monitor.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Docker - Web-App Containerization</h4>
              <p>
                Docker is a platform for creating, deploying, and running
                applications in lightweight, portable containers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using docker to containerize the Web Application ensures
                consistent environments from development to production and makes
                service architecture easier to manage.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>NGINX - Reverse Proxy</h4>
              <p>
                NGINX is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy, also
                commonly used for load balancing.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is extremely fast and resource efficient and includes simple
                configuration for reverse proxy and SSL termination
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Redis - Hot Path Caching</h4>
              <p>
                Redis is an in-memory key-value data store often used as a cache
                or message broker.
              </p>
              <p>
                Redis is extremely low latency which makes it ideal for caching,
                plus it supports advanced structures and is much faster than
                traditional databases for most use cases.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>PostgreSQL — Production Database</h4>
              <p>
                PostgreSQL is an industry-leading open-source relational
                database known for ACID compliance, scalability, and strong SQL
                capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                It provides reliable concurrency, consistent data handling,
                cloud-ready deployment, and better structure than MongoDB for
                user-related data.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>SQLite — Development Database</h4>
              <p>
                SQLite is a lightweight, file-based SQL database bundled with
                Python, ideal for local development.
              </p>
              <p>
                It requires zero setup, integrates cleanly with FastAPI, and
                allows a seamless transition to PostgreSQL for production.

          <p>
            We are currently between steps 2 and 3 of our schedule. We completed
            our requirements acquisition and tech feasibility analysis in
            November, after which we presented our progress at the NAU
            Engineering Fest. The requirements and tech feasibility documents
            which we produced in this step as well as our design review
            presentation from the Engineering Fest can be downloaded from the
            Demo page. Next we moved on to our environment configuration and
            alpha demo, both of which established the foundations upon which we
            will continue development. A brief demo video which demonstrates
            basic functionality as well as an archive of the code base as it was
            during the demo can also be found on the Demo page.
