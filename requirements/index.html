          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            In recent years, USGS and NASA have been shifting their vast
            planetary datasets into the cloud. Currently they use Amazon Web
            Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) to host these datasets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current workflow used by USGS has main three steps. First they
            collect the mission data from NASA, next they store it on the cloud
            using AWS S3 Buckets, and lastly when the data is needed it is
            accessed via a simple S3 file browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            This last step comes with a few problems, stemming from both the
            vast size of the dataset they are working with, which is in the
            range of multiple petabytes, and the current tool that they are
            using, which is a simple file explore like you might have on your
            PC. In order to find specific pieces of data with this system, they
            must manually root through thousands of folders and related files,
            which can massively slow down the workflow.
          </p>
          <ul>
            Some specific limitations that they have mentioned are:
            <li>
              There is no full-text or metadata search option for the files.
            </li>
            <li>Users must manually sift through large repositories.</li>
            <li>
              Limited file visualization, they cannot view file previews,
              summaries, or the files themselves from the browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              Security risks could be going undetected without the proper audit
              tools.
            </li>
          </ul>

              <h3>Requirements Acquisition</h3>
              <p>
                In order to formulate and finalize our list of project
                requirements, we followed a four step process to ensure that our
                client was happy with our project. First we held our initial
                meeting with our client to discuss the problem the team was
                facing, view a demonstration of their workflow, and discuss some
                initial ideas for how to solve the problem. Next, we used what
                we learned from this meeting to draft our initial requirements
                document where we outlined the broad and high priority
                requirements. We then iterated on this document following our
                client's feedback while introducing more detailed and
                non-functional requirements to the draft. We then completed our
                finalized requirements document and presented it to our client
                for approval.
